## üî¨ Development Guidelines

### Python (Backend)

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where possible
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Write unit tests for new features

### TypeScript (Frontend)

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow React best practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and reusable
- Add proper error handling

### Git Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove)
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Add detailed description if needed

Examples:
```
Add: Support for TESS short cadence data
Fix: Phase folding error for long-period planets
Update: Improve biosignature confidence calculation
```

## üß™ Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Add integration tests for new features
- Test with real NASA data when possible

## üìù Documentation

- Update relevant documentation files
- Add docstrings to new functions
- Update README if adding major features
- Include examples in docstrings
