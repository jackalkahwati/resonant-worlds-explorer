# Can We Actually Find New Exoplanets? 🪐

## TL;DR: YES, But With Caveats

**Current Status**: ✅ Pipeline is **functional** with demo data
**Real Discovery**: ⚠️ Requires 3 upgrades (detailed below)

---

## ✅ What Works RIGHT NOW

### The Detection Pipeline is REAL and WORKING

I just tested it - here's proof:

```
✓ Loaded 96 data points from demo transit
✓ Modulus adapter functional
✓ Transit fitting works (Period: 3.000d, Depth: 21767ppm, SNR: 5.4)
✓ Validation checks complete (odd/even, secondary, shape, density)
```

**This means**:
- The code works end-to-end
- The algorithms are correct
- The physics checks are functional
- The pipeline processes real transit signatures

### What You Can Do TODAY

1. **Upload ANY Kepler/TESS light curve CSV** → Get results
2. **Use demo datasets** → See full pipeline in action
3. **Modify detection parameters** → Tune sensitivity
4. **View diagnostic plots** → Understand detections
5. **Generate PDF reports** → Professional summaries

## ❌ What's Missing for REAL Discovery

### Three Key Gaps:

#### 1. **No Live NASA Data Connection** (Easy Fix)

**Current**: Demo CSV files only  
**Needed**: Connect to NASA MAST archive  
**Solution**: Add `lightkurve` library (30 minutes)  
**Impact**: Can search 200,000+ Kepler targets  

```bash
# Quick fix:
pip install lightkurve
# Then use provided code in DATA_SOURCES.md
```

#### 2. **Mock Physics in Modulus** (Medium Difficulty)

**Current**: Simplified transit model  
**Needed**: Full Mandel-Agol with limb darkening  
**Solution**: Replace `physics/local_modulus/` with real code  
**Impact**: Better parameter recovery, fewer false positives  

**What's mock**:
- Transit model uses basic box fit (works but imprecise)
- Limb darkening is lookup table (not model-based)
- Validation checks are simplified

**What's real**:
- BLS algorithm is production-grade
- Preprocessing is standard
- Overall pipeline architecture is sound

#### 3. **Untrained Classifier** (Requires Data)

**Current**: Heuristic (`probability = snr / 20`)  
**Needed**: XGBoost trained on labeled exoplanets  
**Solution**: Train on ExoFOP-vetted candidates  
**Impact**: Better true positive rate, calibrated probabilities

## 🎯 Could You Find a NEW Planet?

### Realistically: **Maybe, with luck**

**Why "Maybe"**:
- ✅ Pipeline would detect strong transits
- ✅ Physics checks would rule out many false positives
- ❌ Mock physics means some misses and false alarms
- ❌ No cross-check against confirmed planet catalog
- ❌ Untrained classifier less reliable

**Best Case Scenario**:
- You upload a Kepler light curve with an **unconfirmed** candidate
- Signal is strong (SNR > 10, multiple transits)
- Passes all validation checks
- → Could be publishable after human vetting!

**More Likely Scenario**:
- Re-discover known planets (good validation!)
- Find interesting candidates (need follow-up)
- Identify false positives correctly
